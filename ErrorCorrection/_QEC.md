# QEC testing

### Implemented surface codes

To be noted that in a future version, logical x and z operations will be implemented in a
class along with each QEC_circuit.

An example which probably needs more explaining can be found in ```testing.py``` and 
an equivalent circuit with simple qubits is in ```equiv.py```
